            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <div class="rules">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The players choose the game mode at the beginning of the game by clicking on the corresponding button.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the "Player vs Player" mode, players switch off after the player "X" to begin the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In "Player vs Machine" mode, the player competes against the computer. Always "X" for the player and "O" for the computer. The player begins play first.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To start a game, the player clicks on one of the empty cells on the tabulator. The computer automatically chooses a free cell in the "Player vs Machine" mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The goal is to be the first person to have three of your markers (an "X" or a "O") on a line, whether it be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A player wins the round and receives a point if they can align three markers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If all of the tabulator's cells are filled up and no player was able to line up three markers, the round ends in a tie and no one is awarded any points. The game automatically restarts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The game consists of 5 rounds. After five rounds, the player with the most points is declared the game's winner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After five rounds, if both players have the same number of points, the game is declared a tie.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any time during the game, players can click the "Restart" button to start a fresh game.
                    </li>
